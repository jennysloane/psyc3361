# PSYC3361: The Psychology Research Internship

"PSYC3361 is designed to be a hands-on research experience, but this year we are not going to do that in the lab. We are going to build the course around open data, giving you the opportunity to learn skills that are critical for conducting reproducible research." - Jenny Richmond (course instructor)

I had the pleasure to help teach this psychology course for 2 terms in 2021. Out of all the pyschology courses I've taught during my PhD, this has been my favorite!! 

In this course, students worked in groups to try to reproduce results from open source journal articles. T1 the papers were all about covid and T2 the theme was "reproduciblity". The students learned about open science, reproducibility, good practice to make research/work transparent and reproducible, and learned R! At the end of the course, students created beautiful rmarkdown documents (that were full of code and very well commented) for their final reports. In both terms, I was blown away by how much the students learned. 

I ran 2 labs/QnA sessions each week for the course. These sessions were a combination of teaching the basics of R and RStudio, answering R related questions students had, and troubleshooting error messages. Because of the pandemic, this course was designed to be delivered completely online, but I believe there would be a huge benefit to running in person if possible... teaching any programming language and trying to help troubleshoot coding issues online is not an easy task! 

# Course Material and Scripts

I've included all of my code and scripts from both terms within this repo. There's a separate folder for Term 1 (T1) and Term 2 (T2). The files and code are slightly better organized for T2 as it was the second time I taught the course, so I had a better understanding of what to prioritize in the labs/QnA sessions. Although the papers the students worked on were different in T1 and T2, a lot of the R material I taught was similar. 

All of the code is written in .Rmd files and I tried to leave a lot of comments. Some .Rmd files have a combination of teaching material (e.g. how to format tables, intro to stats, etc) and students' questions. Because the sessions were designed to leave time for QnA, we asked the students to submit questions/issues their group was having prior to the actual QnA session, so I had time to review the questions and prepare answers or explanations.
